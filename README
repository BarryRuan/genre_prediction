EECS 595 Class Project

To convert raw data to feature maps, use the following codes:
(1). for binary features:
    from features import features.get_features
    train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y = \
      get_features(dataset, 'binary')
(2). for term frequency: 
    import features
    train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y = \
      get_features(dataset, 'frequency')
(3). for tf-idf:
    import features
    train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y = \
      get_features(dataset, 'tf-idf')
For more information of input and output variable type of 
features.get_features, please read  the commont in features.py
